# Imfinity

An Infinite scrolling application with search features. Uses the NASA Image and Video Library API.

## Note: CORS

A temporary CORS error appears after a certain amount of API calls and/or if the API calls occur at a fast rate. I am awaiting a response from the API owner to see if this is an intentional API restriction or an error.
